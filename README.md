##  ðŸ’» About the project</br>

The main goal of this project was come up with a business question about shark attacks and try to answer that using data, to improve data cleaning and manipulation techniques, while starting to create an analytical mindset.

The dataset we were given to work with was the "Global Shark Attack" found in kaggle.

In my work I tryed to figure out where would be the starting point to reduce the number of attacks by investing in raising awareness of how to behave at sea, imposing the investment limit to serve only one region/state.

## ðŸ›  Data Cleaning/Manipulation:

The dataset was very messy, but I conducted this with a diverse set of tools in Python. I focused the data cleaning on my goal, narrowing down the information to answer my business question.

##  ðŸ’» Result Analysis:

After the analysis I concluded that the company efforts should be focused on:

1) Where: Florida, where the majorite of the attacks happen. 
2) What: Surfing, swimming and fishing are the most affected activities. 3) Who: 0-38 (or 0-22, depending on the focus range) are the most vulnarable age groups.*

*Note: The age group could be narrowed down to a smaller group if we had the data that showed a relation between activity and practitioners' age, to focus more precisely on a particular age group.
